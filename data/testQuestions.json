    "question": "A match made in heavenIs there anything wrong with wanting to find a ‘soulmate’ - that one special person who will make the perfect partner? Many of us believe that this is the only kind of true love there is because we’ve been brought up on a diet of romantic pop songs and films that idealise love. We cling to the idea, even though we suspect it’s doomed to failure. After all, around 50 percent of marriages end in divorce in many western countries. So why is the soulmate myth so powerful? Maybe it’s because we don’t like thinking that life is messily random. Or we need a romantic way of describing intense physical attraction. Or maybe it’s just shorthand for the kind of overwhelming emotion we don’t quite understand.\nThroughout history, many great works of literature such as Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet have been based on the idea of romantic love, as have popular works of contemporary fiction such as One Day and Twilight. This isn’t a preoccupation found only in Western cultures either. A Chinese story about lovers destined to be together, regardless of social class, background or geography, dates back to the ninth century. Many of these stories have tragic endings; Romeo and Juliet being a famous example.\nThe founding father of romance is often thought to be the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato. But it was actually the Romantic poet, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who came up with the term ‘soulmate’, as we understand it today. ‘To be happy in married life ... you must have a soulmate,’ he said in a letter in 1822. This was an unconventional opinion, which probably seemed revolutionary at the time, but these days, searching for spiritual completion is the norm.\nNot everyone subscribes to this view, however. A recent study on attitudes to long-term relationships found that couples who have been together a long time are more likely to refer to each other as ‘best friends’ rather than ‘soulmates’, and are unconvinced by the representation of romance in popular culture. They know these over-idealised romances don’t bear any relation to reality - so they don’t take them seriously.\nA pragmatic approach to love would seem to give relationships a better chance of survival. Research carried out by a professor of social psychology at the University of Houston showed that people believing in romantic destiny tend to have relationships that are passionate but short-lived. Only perfection will do - if things go wrong, this can’t be ‘The One’. Research published by Prof. Spike Lee, of Toronto University, and Prof. Norbert Schwarz, of the University of Southern California, confirms these findings. ‘People who implicitly think of relationships as perfect unity between soulmates have worse relationships than people who implicitly think of relationships as a journey of growing and working things out.’\nFinding a partner can seem overwhelming if you’re convinced you’ve got to search the entire world for just one person, so these days many of us have come round to the idea that fate may need a helping hand. This is why one in five UK relationships starts online. As Lori Laius, of Telegraph Dating, says, ‘You’re using today’s technology to help you find someone special.’ This suits men in particular, who typically have always been more hard-headed about the possibility of finding a match made in heaven. And although meeting online doesn’t quite live up to the romantic ideal, it’s now just as normal as meeting someone at a party or at work.\n~Attitudes to love are changing.\n~People's lack of romance leads to divorce.\n~=Accepted beliefs about love are hard to explain.\n~People should forget about trying to find a soulmate.}",

One possible reason (1) this could be the untranslatable concept of 'hygge'. Hygge has already gained a lot of publicity outside Denmark. This is thanks to a stream of recently published self-help books, (2) all urge us to embrace hygge in order to improve our sense of well-being and happiness.\nWriter, Helen Russell, who moved to Denmark several years (3), is a hygge enthusiast. She has been fascinated by the idea ever (4) she arrived. Her book, The Year of Living Danishly: Uncovering The Secrets of the World's Happiest Country, makes it easy to understand (5) Helen and her family are still living (6) . Helen says 'hygge' can be defined (7) 'the absence of anything annoying or emotionally overwhelming'. It's all about being kind to yourself and celebrating the simple things in life, (8) spending time with friends and family, or eating ice cream. So find your inner Dane – and do what makes you happy without feeling guilty about it.",

    "question": "X-Men: The Real-life SuperhumansDisappointingly for comic-book fans, there is no equivalent to X-Men in the real world. But there ore o surprising number of people who - by way of genetic mutation - hove acquired abilities that could comfortably be classed as superhuman.\nA. Liam Hoekstra\nBorn prematurely, it was feared that Liam Hoekstra would be in poor health as he grew up. If anything, the opposite was true and despite initial problems with his heart and kidneys, it was apparent by the age of only five months that Limn was developing superhuman strength. He was diagnosed with a rare condition characterised by an absence of myostati.n. This is a protein which regulates muscle development, a lack of which leads to the kind of physical attributes that athletes can only dream about: 40 percent more muscle than normal, breathtaking strength and speed and almost no body fat. It is possible that the myths about the Greek hero Hercules were based on individuals with this condition. There are no negative side-efef cts; the only possible drawback was that without adequate body fat, brain growth in childhood could be restricted. Thankfully, Liam seems unaffected. His condition is more than a medical rarity; it could help scientists unlock the secrets of muscle growth and deterioration and lead to new treatments for diseases which cause weakness, such as osteoporosis.\nB. Wim Hof\nOne of the original characters in the X-Men was Bobby Drab:, otherwise known as Iceman. As far-fetched as it sounds, in the real world there is a real-life Iceman, called Wim Hof. He may not be able to turn everyday objects into ice, as Bobby Drake did, but he holds 20 world records related to resisting the cold, which he says is the result of meditation practices. Among Hof's achievements are standing submerged in an ice bath for one hour and 44 minutes and running a marathon in the Arctic Circle wearing only shorts. Over a period of 20 minutes in the ice bath his temperature and heart rate remained completely normal. Scientists have confirmed that Hof is indeed able to regulate his body functions; by controlling cell production he gains improved immunity and better cognitive performance. Hof believes the skill is attainable by anyone who can convince themselves they can do it.\nC. Dean Karnazes\nDean Karnazes's muscles have extraordinary properties. Most people suffer intense fatigue and are forced to give up when too much exercising causes lactic acid to build up in their muscles. Not so Karnazes: his body clears the acid with such extraordinary efficiency that he can remain hydrated and functional for re1rnirkably long periods during feats of endurance. His 22-year career includes runmng 350 miles in 80 hours and 44 minutes without sleep, completing a 135-mile ultra-marathon in Death Valley, California, in temperatures of 49C and a marathon in each of the USA's 50 states on 50 consecutive days. Unaware of his 'gift' until he took part in a scientific study at the age of 30, he is convinced that there are people like him everywhere who have no idea they have this ability.\nD. Isao Machii\nThe scientific world is totally confosed by lsao Machii, aJapanese practitioner of laido, the art of the samurai sword, who is the holder of several world records involving fast sword cuts. For one title he had to cut through a te1mis ball travelling at 440 miles per hour. His most impressive feat was when an airgun fired a 5mm plastic pellet at Maclm at a speed of 200mph. At this speed it is not likely that the human eye could track an object of this size and unimaginable that human reflexes could respond.Yet he was able to draw his sword and slice it in two when it was in mid­ air. A psychologist who observed the experiment said “He was expecting it before it happened - a unique form of anticipatory awareness, sort of like Spiderman.„\n~A. Liam Hoekstra\n~B. Wim Hof\n~=C.

    "title": "U6 p62 Reading - Text: Sharing the self love",
    "question": "Sharing the (self) love: the rise of the selfie and digital narcissismWelcome to the age of digital narcissism. We can all name celebrities who are keen users of social media and who we suspect have the following things in common: a desire to be noticed, a self-important view of themselves, superficial personalities and shameless self-publicity. In that sense, they are just like millions of their Facebook and Twitter fans around the world, except successful.\nUntil the 90s, the media provided an escape from reality by transporting viewers to the fictional universe of situational comedy and soap operas.  It did this by broadcasting the allegedly genuine and ordinary lives of everyday people and making them into cultural blockbusters. However, in the past decade, social media appears to have enabled everybody to make their life public and be the star of their own 24/7 show.\nThere are now many mega-successful apps and websites.  It all began with MySpace, a list of hopeful future pop stars and DJs. Then came Facebook, the choice of the average person. YouTube gave everybody their own TV channel, Blogger and Tumblr made us all creative writers. Twitter brought in loads of followers and LinkedIn encouraged us to give each other approval of our professional skills. Instagram made ‘selfie’ the word of the year, while Tinder and Snapchat made Facebook look intellectual.\nUnsurprisingly, narcissism levels have been rising for decades.  At the same time, the advent of Facebook and Twitter has brought with it a steep decline in generosity and levels of sympathy. We are now more connected than ever, but also less interested in other people, except when it comes to finding out what they think about us. It is as if being closer to others made us more antisocial.\nNeedless to say, most social media users are not narcissistic. Yet the more narcissistic you are, the heavier your social media use. Indeed, scientific studies have shown that the number of status updates, attractive selfies, followers and friends are all positively linked to narcissism. \nThe big problem with the rise of digital narcissism is that it puts enormous pressure on people to reach unachievable goals, without necessarily putting in much effort. Wanting to be Beyoncé or Jay Z is hard enough already, but when you are not prepared to work hard to achieve it, you are better off just being less ambitious. Few things are more destructive than the belief that you have the right to something, combined with a lazy work ethic. Ultimately, online evidence of narcissism may be little more than a way of making up for a low and fragile self-esteem.  In this case, reality is misinterpreted and narcissistic fantasies are strengthened.\nPerhaps it is time to turn social media into a therapeutic tool, at the service of the public and society. Examining the rise of narcissism could be done both at an individual and population level.  The aim of this would be to make users aware of their excessive self-promotion, uncontrollable self-love and even signal when an entire population might be at risk of becoming too self-obsessed for its own sake. Or is it too late?\nSocal media encourages people to...(1)\n=1 -> Then came reality TV, which turned the attention back to ourselves.\n=2 -> Interestingly, what they all seem to have in common is digital attention seeking.\n=3 -> Such increases pre-date social media but they have clearly worsened since its arrival.\n=4 -> The explanation for this is that narcissistic individuals are much more likely to use social media to portray an enviable, if unrealistic, self-image, broadcasting their life to an audience and gaining many virtual friends.\n=5 -> Furthermore, the need to be appreciated is a crucial part of psychological wellbeing, unless it is taken too far and becomes a nonstop search to be valued by others.\n=6 -> New ‘self-help’ mathematical formulas could be built into Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n=-> However, the danger is when these efforts to compensate are supported and rewarded by others.\n}",
