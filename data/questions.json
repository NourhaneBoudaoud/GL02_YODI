(2) these stories are true, why do dolphins do it and (3) makes them behave in this way? Scientists (4) have studied them are not entirely sure. For dolphins to act together as a group to save humans implies that (5) is some sort of code of ethics among dolphins, but there is little evidence  for that. The (6) likely explanation is that they instinctively respond to the appearance of predators like sharks by herding weaker members of their own group into (7) safe place - and there is proof that dolphins do cooperate with (8) other to ward off danger. Maybe they just mistake swimmers for part of their group, which would mean that dolphins don’t have genuine feelings of kindness towards humans.
